# Investment-Value-Project-2

This is the Assignment the project was created for 

 COSC 501/500   Project 2        
 
Write a function that computes future investment value at a given  interest rate for a specified number of years. The future investment is determined using the following formula: 
 
Accumulative Value =  investmentAmount * (1 + MonthlyInterestRate) NumberofYears*12 
 
For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98. 
 
The function should have three parameters: investmentAmount, monthlyInterestRate, years. 
 
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the investment amount (e.g., 1000) and the interest rate (e.g., 9%), and print a table that displays the future value for the years from 1 to 30, as shown below: 
 
The amount invested: 1000 Annual interest rate: 9% 
 
Years   Future value <br>

1   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        1093.8 
2    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      1196.41 
3     &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;      .. 
30    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;     14730.57 
 
 
Of course, you need to use a loop to calculate and print the values 30 times. 
 
Submit your program along with the output 
 
Remarks: 
 
- Your program should at least consist of two functions, the main function and a function that calculates the balance 
 
 
Happy Investing!
